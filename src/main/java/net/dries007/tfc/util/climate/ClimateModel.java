/**
 * <h1>Climate Models</h1>
 * Represents the model for the climate for a dimension. This is the core object which determines all aspects of TFC climate,
 * from temperature, rainfall, current rain, wind, and fog.
 * <p>
 * Climate models are assigned to dimensions using the {@link SelectClimateModelEvent}. TFC listens to this event at highest
 * priority and will assign an overworld climate model for the overworld. If no climate model is assigned, the dimension will
 * default to using a biome-based climate model. In order to override the climate model for the overworld or any other dimension,
 * you simply must listen to the event at normal priority and select the climate model appropriately.
 * <h3>Query Types</h3>
 * Most climate queries can be represented as one of two types:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Queries that ask factors about the average annual climate, such as average temperature, or average rainfall</li>
 *     <li>Queries that ask factors about the climate at a given timestamp</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that climate models are not ticked in any way, so all climate calculations must be able to be fully re-created from scratch,
 * on an arbitrary query time.
 * <h3>Client-Side</h3>
 * Climate models are synced to client, and can expose some properties to be synced via the stream codec on the {@link ClimateModelType}.
 * Note that these are not synced on modification - they are assumed to be constant.
 * <p>
 * On client side, there is a cache of the current climate at the current time and player's position which can be accessed
 * via {@link ClimateRenderCache}. If doing frequent climate queries on client-side, at the player position, consider using this
 * instead. It is updated on client tick to reflect the current climate.
